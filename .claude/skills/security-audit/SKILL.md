# Security Auditing Workflow Bundle

## Overview

Comprehensive security auditing workflow for web applications, APIs, and infrastructure. This bundle orchestrates skills for penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, security scanning, and remediation.

## When to Use This Workflow

Use this workflow when:
- Performing security audits on web applications
- Testing API security
- Conducting penetration tests
- Scanning for vulnerabilities
- Hardening application security
- Compliance security assessments

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance

#### Skills to Invoke
- `scanning-tools` - Security scanning
- `shodan-reconnaissance` - Shodan searches
- `top-web-vulnerabilities` - OWASP Top 10

#### Actions
1. Identify target scope
2. Gather intelligence
3. Map attack surface
4. Identify technologies
5. Document findings

#### Copy-Paste Prompts
```
Use @scanning-tools to perform initial reconnaissance
```

```
Use @shodan-reconnaissance to find exposed services
```

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Scanning

#### Skills to Invoke
- `vulnerability-scanner` - Vulnerability analysis
- `security-scanning-security-sast` - Static analysis
- `security-scanning-security-dependencies` - Dependency scanning

#### Actions
1. Run automated scanners
2. Perform static analysis
3. Scan dependencies
4. Identify misconfigurations
5. Document vulnerabilities

#### Copy-Paste Prompts
```
Use @vulnerability-scanner to scan for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
```

```
Use @security-scanning-security-dependencies to audit dependencies
```

### Phase 3: Web Application Testing

#### Skills to Invoke
- `top-web-vulnerabilities` - OWASP vulnerabilities
- `sql-injection-testing` - SQL injection
- `xss-html-injection` - XSS testing
- `broken-authentication` - Authentication testing
- `idor-testing` - IDOR testing
- `file-path-traversal` - Path traversal
- `burp-suite-testing` - Burp Suite testing

#### Actions
1. Test for injection flaws
2. Test authentication mechanisms
3. Test session management
4. Test access controls
5. Test input validation
6. Test security headers

#### Copy-Paste Prompts
```
Use @sql-injection-testing to test for SQL injection vulnerabilities
```

```
Use @xss-html-injection to test for cross-site scripting
```

```
Use @broken-authentication to test authentication security
```

### Phase 4: API Security Testing

#### Skills to Invoke
- `api-fuzzing-bug-bounty` - API fuzzing
- `api-security-best-practices` - API security

#### Actions
1. Enumerate API endpoints
2. Test authentication/authorization
3. Test rate limiting
4. Test input validation
5. Test error handling
6. Document API vulnerabilities

#### Copy-Paste Prompts
```
Use @api-fuzzing-bug-bounty to fuzz API endpoints
```

### Phase 5: Penetration Testing

#### Skills to Invoke
- `pentest-commands` - Penetration testing commands
- `pentest-checklist` - Pentest planning
- `ethical-hacking-methodology` - Ethical hacking
- `metasploit-framework` - Metasploit

#### Actions
1. Plan penetration test
2. Execute attack scenarios
3. Exploit vulnerabilities
4. Document proof of concept
5. Assess impact

#### Copy-Paste Prompts
```
Use @pentest-checklist to plan penetration test
```

```
Use @pentest-commands to execute penetration testing
```

### Phase 6: Security Hardening

#### Skills to Invoke
- `security-scanning-security-hardening` - Security hardening
- `auth-implementation-patterns` - Authentication
- `api-security-best-practices` - API security

#### Actions
1. Implement security controls
2. Configure security headers
3. Set up authentication
4. Implement authorization
5. Configure logging
6. Apply patches

#### Copy-Paste Prompts
```
Use @security-scanning-security-hardening to harden application security
```

### Phase 7: Reporting

#### Skills to Invoke
- `reporting-standards` - Security reporting

#### Actions
1. Document findings
2. Assess risk levels
3. Provide remediation steps
4. Create executive summary
5. Generate technical report

## Security Testing Checklist

- [ ] XML External Entities (XXE)
- [ ] Broken Access Control
- [ ] Security Misconfiguration
- [ ] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- [ ] Insecure Deserialization
- [ ] Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
- [ ] Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

### API Security
